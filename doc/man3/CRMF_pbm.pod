=head1 NAME

  OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new,
  OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new - functions for calculating Password-based MAC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include <openssl/crmf.h>

  int OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new(const OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *pbmp,
                        const unsigned char *msg, size_t msglen,
                        const unsigned char *sec, size_t seclen,
                        unsigned char **mac, unsigned int *maclen);

  OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new(size_t saltlen, int owfnid,
                                             long itercnt, int macnid);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new() generates a PBM (Password-based MAC) based on given
PBM parameters B<pbmp>, message B<msg>, secret B<sec>, along with the respective
octet lengths B<msglen>, B<seclen>.  Will write pointers to the newly allocated
MAC into the given B<mac> and the respective octet lenght into the int B<maclen>
points to. The target of B<mac> will be freed if not NULL.

Iteration count must be at least 100, as stipulated by RFC 4211, and can
be at most 100000 to avoid DoS through manipulated or otherwise malformed
input.

OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new() initializes and returns a new PBMParameter
structure with new a random salt of given octet length B<saltlen>, OWF (one-way
function) NID B<owfnid>, iteration count B<itercnt>, and MAC NID B<macnid>.

Iteration count is enforced to be at least 100, as stipulated by RFC 4211.

=head1 NOTES

The OWF (one-way function) and for the MAC (message authentication code) may be
any with a NID defined in the header file B<objects.h>, which also should
include NID_hmac_sha1 which is specified by RFC 4210.

RFC 4210 recommends that the salt SHOULD be at least 8 octets (64 bits) long.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new() returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new() returns a new and initialized OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER
structure, or NULL on error.

=head1 EXAMPLE

OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *pbm = NULL;
unsiged char *msg = "Hello";
unsiged char *sec = "SeCrEt";
unsiged char *mac = NULL;
unsiged int maclen;

if ((pbm = OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new(16, NID_sha256, 500, NID_hmac_sha1) == NULL))
    goto err;
if (!OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new(pbm, msg, 5, sec, 6, &mac, &maclen))
    goto err;
